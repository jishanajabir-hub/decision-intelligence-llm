# Decision Intelligence System using Simulation + LLM

A **production-style Decision Intelligence system** that combines Monte Carlo simulation, causal features, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to support **data-driven business decisions** in e-commerce operations.

This project is intentionally designed beyond beginner tutorials and reflects how real-world ML + analytics systems are structured in industry.

## Business Problem

E-commerce platforms must make decisions under uncertainty, such as:
- Should we offer discounts to a seller?
- Which orders are at high risk of delay?
- How do logistics and payment methods affect outcomes?

Traditional dashboards show *what happened*.
This system helps answer **“what should we do next?”**

## Solution Overview

We build a Decision Intelligence pipeline that:
1. Models uncertainty using **Monte Carlo simulation**
2. Generates counterfactual outcomes for decisions
3. Uses an **LLM** to explain results in natural language
4. Produces **actionable recommendations**, not just predictions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/farsanamajeed-09/decision-intelligence-llm.git
```

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run notebooks in order:
- Data exploration
- Feature engineering
- Simulation modeling

🧪 Example Decision Question
“If we change the payment method mix, how does delivery delay risk change?”
The system:
- Simulates thousands of possible futures
- Scores decision outcomes
- Explains results in plain English using an LLM

## Output
- Risk scores per decision
- Scenario comparisons
- LLM-generated explanations for stakeholders

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:
- Thinking beyond accuracy metrics
- Decision-first ML design
- Handling real-world uncertainty with simulation
- Clear communication between ML systems and human decision-makers

This README alone signals **production ML thinking**.
